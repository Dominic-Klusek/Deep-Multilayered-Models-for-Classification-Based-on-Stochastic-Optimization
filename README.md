# Deep-Multilayered-Models-for-Classification-Based-on-Stochastic-Optimization
My first research into Machine Learning, and the accompanying paper which was accepted and presented at the 2018 IEEE MIT Undergraduate Research Technology Conference.

Multilayer Perceptron was created utilizing Keras library in Python.
